                            This is an EA game. That could be the entire review. When this came launched, it was RIDDLED with disgusting microtransactions. You’d have to play for hundreds of hours just unlock Darth Vader, or you could toss EA a few bucks. It was horrendous and ruined the game from the start. It’s a shame because after they patched that stuff out, we have the best Star Wars multiplayer shooter in 2025. But EA being EA, they’ve cut support and don’t plan to make another iteration.

                            Made by the makers of Titanfall and Apex Legends, people didn’t know what to expect. Turns out, the game is one of the best singleplayer Star Wars games ever. Cameron Monaghan puts on a great performance as Cal Kestis, so much so that he’s probably in my top 5 favorite characters in the franchise. Love the poncho.

                            Somehow they managed to make the sequel a better game. The worlds were larger, more powers, more lightsaber stances, more customization. And the story was just as strong as the first one. The story is immersive, the worlds are beautiful, the gameplay loop is entertaining.
