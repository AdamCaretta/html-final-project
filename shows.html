          <!--The modals. These were really frustrating to make, but I like how it looks so
          I stuck with it. From my understanding, when onclick is called in the section above, it uses the functions I wrote
          above. This allows the popup to pop up. Then on each modal there is a review. Then using 
          another JS function, it closes the modal. Originally I wanted to add animations to the popup but I haven't learned that
          enough to implement.-->

                        <h2>Tales of the Jedi</h2>
                        <p>For years, the fans wanted to see Count Dooku before he was Darth Tyrannus. Over the course of the 3 episode arc you can see him slowly becoming less and less “Jedi-like”. Eventually, it is revealed that he has been working with Darth Sidious. He fully embraces his change to the dark side by killing Yaddle when she confronts him over this. The other 3 episodes follow my personal favorite character, Ahsoka Tano. It flashes back to Anakin accidentally teaching her how to survive Order 66. Obviously this wasn’t the intention, but it happened. And her interaction with the inquisitor is top notch.

                            I enjoyed this series. It was not as strong as Tales of the Jedi, but I did really enjoy it. The beginning of Cad Bane was cool to see, although maybe unnecessary. I feel like everyone always wants to see the beginning of everything. Sometimes things being unexplained or ambiguous is perfect and acceptable.

                            The Clone Wars is a great show. In my opinion, I’d put it as the second best Star Wars show we’ve seen. Second to Andor of course. There are definitely some lows of this show. Episodes that just don't do much for the narrative. But, that’s okay because the highs are just so high. The final 4 episodes of season 7 are close to the greatest Star Wars has ever been.

                            I don’t even know where to start. This show is just above everything else. It is so beautifully written, directed, acted, just everything that has to do with shows, it does it the best. Mon Mothma’s speech in season 2, the sunrise Lucen will never see, the manifesto, friends everywhere. This was a phenomenal show that just happened to be set in the Star Wars universe.

                        <p>This show was released by Disney right after they bought the IP. It starts off very clearly as a children’s show, but over time it touches on loss and grief and more adult thought processes. Dare I say, it is a more consistent show than The Clone Wars. Although, The Clone Wars has higher highs, it has lower lows than Rebels.

                            The first live action Star Wars show. That first time Mando walked into the bar looking for his target felt like a western in all the right ways. Season 1 was spectacular. Season 2’s ending was a monumental moment in franchise history, ignoring the shotty deepfake face.

                            I’m not really all that sure where to start with this. The show kind of sucked except for the episodes that were actually about a completely different character. For 40 years fans begged for Boba Fett to return from the Sarlacc pit. And when they finally give us that, he’s a shell of himself. He doesn’t seem to want to be the bounty hunter we all knew and loved. Just a huge hit and miss.

                            This was kind of a surreal moment for so many people. Hayden Christensen came back to play Anakin again. The scenes with the flashbacks to Clone Wars era Anakin and Ahsoka are just magical. Seeing Ahsoka go from the little Padawan in Clone Wars, to now being a full blown adult is incredible.
