                        <h3>The Phantom Menace</h3>
                        <p>
                            I think I will always have a soft spot for this film. I’d be lying to myself if I said the dialogue isn't written a little poorly, but the story is solid. George Lucas was never known for great dialogue, he was known for great storytelling. Which can be done through worldbuilding. Qui-Gon Jinn and Duel of the Fates are two of the highlights in the film. In the Original Trilogy we see the aftermath of the downfall of the Republic. This film shows us the lead up to the downfall of the Republic, and personally I would argue it shows the Jedi have already fallen. People like to complain about the story revolving around the politics of the universe, but of course there was going to be political intrigue. The story is about wars. Oh, and Jar Jar is not THAT bad, he's just not all that great.

                        <h3>Attack Of The Clones</h3>
                        <p>
                            I don't think the film overall is a bad film. It's just definitely the weakest of the original six films. The dialogue is incredibly bad. This movie really bothers me with just how dumb the Jedi have become. They are flat out told by Dooku that a Sith Lord has taken over the Senate, and Obi-Wan Kenobi just kind of brushes it off without a second thought. The Order thought it made sense to leave Anakin alone with the Queen of Naboo. Then he goes to save his mother, who ends up dying in his arms. And any semblance of Anakin’s mental stability is just on its way out the door. If the Jedi weren’t a shell of what they used to be, Yoda or other powerful members of the Order would’ve been able to sense the trouble in Anakin much earlier. As a fan of the franchise, I enjoy the Geonosis scenes and Kenobi on Kamino, but I’m not sure they’re enough to carry the film in its entirety.

                        <h3>Revenge Of The Sith</h3>
                        <p>
                            The opening sequence of this film is possibly the best in the series. It showcases Anakin’s elite flying ability and being incredibly confident in battle while only being 22 years old. We really see the conflict within Anakin due to his love of Padme and the forbidden attachments rule in the Jedi Order. Something that has always bothered me is the Jedi Council doing nothing but pushing Anakin to the Dark Side. Yoda senses Anakin’s conflict and doesn’t do much of anything to help him. Then he is not granted the rank of Master even though he has more than earned it. Anakin’s fall to the Dark Side is one of the more tragic stories we’ve seen in media.

                        <h3>Solo: A Star Wars Story</h3>
                        <p>
                            Probably the most unnecessary film set in the Galaxy Far Far Away. I do love a good prequel to a great story, but sometimes the story is best left untold. In Solo, they explain how Han gets the last name “Solo”. Which is… because he was alone when he joined the military? Although this movie has plenty of negatives and attempts to fill holes from this Original Trilogy that just didn’t need to be filled, it has redeeming qualities. The reveal of the Crime Syndicate being headed up by Darth Maul, who is dead to anyone who hasn’t watched the shows, was interesting. It’s just frustrating this never really went anywhere. Throughout the whole story Beckett, a scoundrel Han teams with, teaches him to trust nobody, which ends with Han taking Beckett out because he doesn’t trust him. Not a horrible movie, but honestly never should have been made.

                        <h3>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</h3>
                        <p>
                            This is arguably the greatest movie in the entirety of Star Wars. The story follows Jyn Erso, daughter of the engineer Galen Erson, who is behind the schematics of the Death Star. She ends up with the already established Rebellion. The growth of the group of characters from the beginning to the end is unbelievable. Shows how a ragtag group of people can topple an Empire. It is impossible for me to do this movie justice in a short review. Darth Vader’s appearance at the end of the film shows just how absolutely brutal and terrifying he was. Andor, Rogue One, A New Hope become a new trilogy.

                        <h3>A New Hope</h3>
                        <p>
                            The movie that started it all. Right from the start, you’re asking for more. Vader invading the “diplomatic” ship has you asking so many questions about who this guy is, and what’s at stake. The introduction of all the no beloved characters; Leia, Luke, Obi-Wan, Han, Chewy, the Cantina, R2 and C3PO. The movie just makes sense. Luke learning he’s capable of much more than he thought, trusting the Force to help him destroy the Death Star. Even though the plot is relatively simple, it’s great. The worldbuilding still holds up and is responsible for one of the largest IPs on the face of the planet.

                        <h3>The Empire Strikes Back</h3>
                        <p>
                            The infamous reveal of Darth Vader’s true identity must have caused craziness back in 1980. Between Rogue One and Empire Strikes Back, one of them is the greatest film in the series. I don’t know if it is just me, but I love when the good guys actually lose at the end of the movie. Luke gets his hand chopped off, Han is in carbonite, and the rebels are in no better position than they were at the beginning. It shows us that failure is the best teacher.

                        <h3>Return Of The Jedi</h3>
                        <p>
                            I personally do not mind the Ewoks. People are always all up in arms about these silly teddy bear type characters. There are so many memorable moments. Luke seemingly acts in a more dark way, Jabba’s Palace, Yoda dying, and Boba Fett becoming a fan favorite with under 10 minutes of screen time. Possibly the greatest move any Jedi could make is Luke still seeing the good in his father, down to the very end. He throws away his lightsaber, refuses to join the Emperor and the dark side. Forces Darth Vader to allow Anakin to come back out and save his son.

                        <h3>The Force Awakens</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Force Awakens is the first movie made after the Disney acquisition. It is certainly the most watchable of the Sequel Trilogy movies. Part of that is because it is before they tarnish the legacy of one of cinema’s greatest characters, being Luke Skywalker. Another is because it kind of just felt like a rehash of A New Hope. I actually like the idea of the character Rey. Daisy Ridley is a talented actress and her character could have been great. This film introduced Kylo Ren, who I’d considered the best character in the entire trilogy.

                        <h3>The Last Jedi</h3>
                        <p>
                            This is the worst Star Wars movie to date. I have no idea what they were thinking. Luke Skywalker, the man who saw the good in the most brutal man in the galaxy, didn’t know what to do when his nephew had a bad dream? Then we take Finn and Rose, and send them off to Canto, for what? A redeeming factor is Poe realizing his disobeying orders actually had a great cost, even though they “won” that battle. For some reason, Disney allowed Rian Johnson to kill Snoke, who has been portrayed as the new villain for the trilogy, except now he isn’t because halfway through the 2nd entry he’s dead? Overall I feel this movie was a huge misstep, and clearly so did Disney because they attempted to correct it in the next film.

                        <h3>The Rise of Skywalker</h3>
                        <p>
                            This movie is slightly not as horrendous as its predecessor. “Somehow Palpatine returned” is possibly the dumbest thing I’ve heard. If they didn’t kill Snoke, there could have been a pretty cool villain here. Instead now we have the big bad villain who was famously slain by the newly redeemed Anakin Skywalker, somehow back. So now that Palpatine has not been completely offed, did Anakin really bring balance to the Force? Or was the prophecy wrong? Or is it just horrendous writing?
